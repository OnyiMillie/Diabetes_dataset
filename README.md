The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and contains approximately 82,000–100,000 individual observations (rows) and about 15–18 variables (columns), depending on preprocessing and derived features. It includes demographic factors (age, gender), health indicators (BMI, blood glucose, HbA1c, hypertension, heart disease), behavioral factors (smoking history), geographic identifiers (location), and a binary diabetes outcome. The structure supports descriptive, stratified, and multivariable analyses of diabetes prevalence and risk factors across population subgroups and locations.
